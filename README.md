# tplink wifi smart led bulb with color (hue)

### Update 28 March 17
Thanks to [LucidObscurity](https://github.com/LucidObscurity "LucidObscurity") 
Code for TP-Link's smart bulbs added, guess LB100, LB110, LB120, LB130. Unable to test yet because
they currently not available in Germany. But code looks pretty good. 👍
